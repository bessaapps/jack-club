      </p>
      <p>
        As a part of our commitment to ensuring a safe and welcoming environment
        for all users, especially within our OnlyFans business which can have a
        wide spectrum of content and interactions, we have established the
        following community guidelines:
      </p>
      <p>
        Respect and Inclusivity: All users are expected to treat each other with
        respect, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, or background.
        Discriminatory behavior, hate speech, or any form of harassment will
        result in immediate suspension or termination of the offending account.
      </p>
      <p>
        No Explicit or Offensive Content without Warning: While we recognize the
        diverse nature of content on OnlyFans, explicit content should be
        clearly marked and not be used in profile pictures or public posts. Any
        form of content that promotes violence, hate, or illegal activities is
        strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consent is Paramount: Never share or post images, videos, or any content
        of another person without their explicit consent. Non-consensual
        distribution of private images or videos will lead to immediate account
        termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Age Restriction: All content creators and consumers must be above the
        age of 18 or the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction. We have a
        zero-tolerance policy against child exploitation; any accounts found in
        violation will be reported to the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respect Privacy: Do not disclose private information about others,
        including addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, without
        explicit consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spam and Solicitation: Unsolicited promotions, advertisements, or spam
        will not be tolerated. Any attempt to deceive or scam other members will
        result in account suspension.
      </p>
      <p>
        No Harmful or Dangerous Activities: Content that promotes harm or
        depicts harmful, dangerous, or illegal activities is strictly
        prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, promoting self-harm,
        drug use, or criminal activities.

        <strong>CONTENT SHARING AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To safeguard the rights of our creators and maintain the integrity of
        our platform, especially within our OnlyFans business, we&#39;ve
        established intellectual property guidelines:
      </p>
      <p>
        Ownership of Content: All content uploaded by users remains the
        intellectual property of the original creator. By uploading content,
        users grant the platform a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute said content solely
        for the purposes of operating, promoting, and improving our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protection of Intellectual Property: We respect the intellectual
        property rights of others. It is our policy to respond to any claim that
        content posted on the platform infringes on the copyright or other
        intellectual property rights of any person or entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reporting Infringements: If you are a copyright owner or authorized on
        behalf of one, and you believe that copyrighted work has been copied in
        a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please submit your claim
        via our established reporting mechanisms, providing detailed
        information, including the nature of your rights, proof of ownership,
        and the specifics of the infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take-Down and Dispute Resolution: Upon receiving a legitimate
        infringement report, we will take appropriate action, including removing
        the content in question and notifying the user who posted it. Users who
        believe their content was wrongfully removed can appeal the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeated Infringements: Users found to repeatedly infringe on the rights
        of others will face escalating consequences, including permanent account
        suspension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respecting Licensing and Attribution: If you share content that
        isn&#39;t originally yours, ensure you have the right to distribute it
        and provide appropriate credit or attribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Derivative Works: If a user&#39;s content inspires derivative works or
        is remixed or transformed by another user, the original creator should
        be credited, and any new creations should not violate the original
        creator&#39;s rights or the platform&#39;s guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial Use: Commercial use of any content on the platform without
        explicit permission from the content creator or rights holder is
        strictly prohibited.

        Transparency and Disclosure: Any Collaboration involving endorsements,
        promotions, or exchange of services/products must be transparently
        declared to the community. All parties involved in the Collaboration
        should disclose the nature of their partnership to ensure full
        transparency and integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intellectual Property: Rights to content produced as a result of

      <p>
        Definition: Business agreements refer to contractual relationships
        established with third parties, including influencers, brands, or other

        Disclosure: Any content, post, or interaction that is a result of a paid
        endorsement or under a business agreement must be clearly labeled or
        disclosed. This ensures our community can distinguish between organic
        content and promotional content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exclusivity: Certain business agreements may stipulate exclusivity
        terms, restricting parties from promoting, endorsing, or entering into
        agreements with competing brands or entities for a defined period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Termination and Consequences: Breach of any business agreement or

        Reporting Mechanisms: Users have the right and are encouraged to report
        any harmful, offensive, or suspicious activities or content on our

      </p>
      <p>
        Monitoring and Moderation: To maintain safety and integrity, certain
        sections or activities on our platform may be monitored or moderated.
        This helps in ensuring content and interactions align with our
        guidelines and community ethos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal Safety: Users are urged to prioritize their safety and never
        disclose sensitive personal information like home addresses, financial
        details, or other private data. While our platform offers opportunities
        to connect and collaborate, physical meet-ups or off-platform
        interactions should be approached with caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community-led Initiatives: We encourage users to take active roles in
        shaping our community. Suggestions, feedback, or community-led

        they offer for exchange. All parties involved in an exchange are advised
        to exercise caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and ensure they are
        fully informed before committing to any exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disputes: Disputes arising from exchanges are to be resolved directly
        between the involved parties. While the platform may offer limited
        mediation, we are not obligated to do so and are not liable for any

        resolve the dispute informally by contacting us directly.
      </p>

        Arbitration: If the disputes are not resolved within 30 days, both
        parties agree to resolve any claims related to these terms or the

      <p>
        Governing Law: These terms and the resolution of any disputes shall be
        governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Las Vegas,

        shall be instituted only in the federal or state courts located in Las

      <p>
        Severability: If any provision of these terms is deemed invalid or
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision shall

        and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver: No waiver of any provision of these terms by us shall be deemed
        a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision,
        and our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms shall
        not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assignment: You may not assign or transfer these terms or your rights
        under these terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or

        these T\&amp;Cs periodically for any changes. Continued use of or access

        constitutes acceptance of those changes. We may also, in the future,
        offer new services and/or features through the platform (including the
        release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services
        shall be subject to the terms and conditions of these T\&amp;Cs. If you
