        At Jack Club, we want everyone to feel safe and happy. Our club is all
        about celebrating Adult(18+) male (called Jacks) masturbation and
        brotherhood. The Code of Conduct is here to help you have fun and stay
        comfortable while being a member of Jack Club.

        You might wonder, what is a Jack Club? Jack Clubs started in the 1980s
        during the HIV/AIDS pandemic. They were created to give men a safe way
        to be sexual. Jack Clubs are places where men can masturbate alone or
        together. We make sure the space is safe & welcoming for everyone. We
        have a strict rule: &quot;Lips Above the Hips, No Poles in Holes.&quot;

        When you come to any Jack Club event, it&apos;s very important to ask
        for consent. Always ask before touching anyone else.
