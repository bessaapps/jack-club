      </p>
      <p>
        In our commitment to respect and safeguard your privacy, you are

      <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants EU residents the
        following rights regarding their personal data:
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Access: This empowers you to obtain a copy of your personal
        data that we possess. It ensures you&#39;re aware of and can verify the
        lawfulness of the processing. Upon request, we will provide you with
        information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third
        party, any of your personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Rectification: If your personal data is inaccurate or
        incomplete, you have the right to have it corrected. We are dedicated to
        maintaining accurate records, but it&#39;s crucial you make sure the
        data you provide to us is accurate and that you update it if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Erasure (&quot;right to be forgotten&quot;): In specific
        circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary in relation
        to the purpose for which it was collected or if you withdraw your
        consent, you can request that we delete your personal data. This is not
        an absolute right and may be subject to legal retention requirements or
        other legitimate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Restrict Processing: This allows you to ask us to suspend
        processing personal data about you, for example, if you want us to
        establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Data Portability: You have the right to receive your personal
        data in a structured, standard machine-readable format and to send this
        to another organization controlling your personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Object: You have the right to object to certain types of
        processing, including processing for direct marketing and profiling. You
        can block or restrict us from processing your data in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2.</strong> CCPA Rights (for California residents)
      </p>
      <p>
        The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) endows California residents
        with specific rights related to their personal information:
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Know: You have the right to request that we disclose specific
        information about our collection and use of your personal information
        over the past 12 months. This includes:The categories of personal
        information we&#39;ve collected about you.
      </p>
      <p>· The categories of sources for that information.</p>
      <p>
        · Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        · The categories of third parties with whom we&#39;ve shared the
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Delete: Under CCPA, you have the right to request the
        deletion of your personal data collected or maintained by us. However,
        this right is subject to exceptions; for example, where the information
        is needed to fulfill a legal obligation or to detect and protect against
        security incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Right to Non-Discrimination: We respect your choice to exercise your
        CCPA rights, and we assure you that we will not deny our services,
        charge you different prices, or provide a different level or quality of
        services simply because you exercised these rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        In exercising your privacy rights, it&#39;s essential to understand that
        these rights are not absolute. They don&#39;t always apply in all
        situations and for all data, and there are exceptions. It&#39;s also
        paramount that you reach out and engage with us if you have concerns
        about your data or if you wish to exercise any of your rights. We are
        here to help and ensure that your personal data is handled with the
        utmost care.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.1.</strong> Sharing
      </p>
      <p>
        We value your trust and strive to keep your data confidential. However,
        in order to optimize our services, we sometimes share data with:
      </p>
      <p>

        traffic patterns.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>

        shared is subject to strict confidentiality agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.2.</strong> International Transfers
      </p>
      <p>
        The digital nature of our platform means data may sometimes be processed
        outside of your home country. When this happens:
      </p>
      <p>
        · Safety Measures: We ensure that the country provides adequate data
        protection measures or rely on legal instruments like Standard
        Contractual Clauses.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Data Centers: Your personal data may be stored in servers located in a
        different country. However, we ensure these data centers adhere to
        global security standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. DATA SECURITY</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the era of frequent cyber threats, the protection of your data
        remains our utmost priority. Here&#39;s how we ensure its security:
      </p>
      <p>
        · Encryption: All data transferred between our platform and your device
        is encrypted, ensuring it remains confidential.
      </p>

        unauthorized access to our systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Regular Audits: We conduct routine security audits to identify and fix
        potential vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        · Employee Training: Our staff undergoes regular training to stay
        updated on best practices in cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while we strive for excellence in safeguarding your data, no
        method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. It&#39;s
        crucial to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to
        your computer. Always sign off when finished using a shared computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong>

        16 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 16, you are not

      <p>

        under the age of 16, we will take necessary steps to delete such data
        from our records promptly. If you believe we might have any information
        from or about a child under 16, please reach out to us immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong>
      </p>
      <p>

        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different Privacy Practices: Every website has its own operational
